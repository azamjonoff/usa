    <h2>Brief information about Alabama</h2>
    <p><b>Alabama (/ˌæləˈbæmə/) is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States. It borders Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th largest by area[9] and the 24th-most populous of the 50 U.S. states.
        Alabama is nicknamed the Yellowhammer State, after the state bird. Alabama is also known as the "Heart of Dixie" and the "Cotton State". The state tree is the longleaf pine, and the state flower is the camellia. Alabama's capital is Montgomery, and its largest city by population and area is Huntsville.[11] Its oldest city is Mobile, founded by French colonists (Alabama Creoles) in 1702 as the capital of French Louisiana.[12][13] Greater Birmingham is Alabama's largest metropolitan area and its economic center.

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p><b>The European-American naming of the Alabama River and state was derived from the Alabama people, a Muskogean-speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river.[16] In the Alabama language, the word for a person of Alabama lineage is Albaamo (or variously Albaama or Albàamo in different dialects; the plural form is Albaamaha).[17] The word's spelling varies significantly among historical sources.[18] The first usage appears in three accounts of the Hernando de Soto expedition of 1540: Garcilaso de la Vega used Alibamo, while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote Alibamu and Limamu, respectively, in transliterations of the term.[18] As early as 1702, the French called the tribe the Alibamon, with French maps identifying the river as Rivière des Alibamons.[16] Other spellings of the name have included Alibamu, Alabamo, Albama, Alebamon, Alibama, Alibamou, Alabamu, and Allibamou.[18][19][20] The use of state names derived from Native American languages is common in the U.S.; an estimated 26 states have names of Native American origin.</b></p><hr>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p><b>Indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of European colonization. Trade with the northeastern tribes by the Ohio River began during the Burial Mound Period (1000 BCE – 700 CE) and continued until European contact.</b></p><hr>
