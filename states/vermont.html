    <h3>About Vermont</h3>
    <p><b>ermont</b> is a landlocked state in the New England region of the Northeastern United States. It borders Massachusetts to the south, New Hampshire to the east, New York to the west, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north. As of the 2020 U.S. census, the state had a population of 643,503,[7] ranking it the second least populated U.S. state ahead of Wyoming. It is the nation's sixth smallest state in area. The state's capital of Montpelier is the least populous U.S. state capital. No other U.S. state has a most populous city with fewer residents than Burlington. Vermont is also well known for being the largest producer of true maple syrup in the United States for over 200 years.</p><hr>
    <h3>Toponymy</h3>
    <p><b>In 1777, the territory then known as the New Hampshire Grants declared itself independent, as the Republic of New Connecticut. It was renamed to the Republic of Vermont six months later.[10] The earliest known reference to the Green Mountains is in the context of the Green Mountain Boys in 1772. In fact, documents using "Green Mountains" predate those mentioning "Vermont", which appears for the first time in English publications in 1778, including a map by Bernard Romans.[11] No French document before 1760 (including letters, journals, military reports, and maps) makes reference to any name resembling Vermont.[11] Claude J. Sauthier's 1779 map names the Green Mountains, although his earlier maps of 1776–78 do not.[11] Before 1780, no map based on the surveys or compilations of Thomas Jefferys, John Montresor, and others, includes Vermont or Green Mountains.[11] Hence, the historical record indicates that the name Vermont first came into widespread use in the 1770s, initially as the Green Mountains (French: “Verts Monts”).</b></p><hr>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p><b>The first humans to inhabit what is now Vermont arrived about 11,000 years ago, as the glaciers of the last ice age receded.[12] Small groups of hunter-gatherers followed herds of caribou, elk, and mastodon through the grasslands of the Champlain Valley. At that time much of region was mixed tundra. The oldest human artifacts are 11,000 year old projectile points found along the eastern shore of the saltwater Champlain Sea.[13] This time is known as the Paleo-Indian period.</b></p><hr>
