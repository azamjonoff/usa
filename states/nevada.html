    <h3>about Nevada</h3>
    <p><b>Nevada</b> is a state in the Western region of the United States.[c] It borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast, and Utah to the east. Nevada is the 7th-most extensive, the 32nd-most populous, and the 9th-least densely populated of the U.S. states. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las Vegas–Paradise metropolitan area,[5] including three of the state's four largest incorporated cities.[6] Nevada's capital is Carson City. Las Vegas is the largest city in the state.</p><hr>
    <h3>Etymology</h3>
    <p><b>The name "Nevada" comes from the Spanish adjective nevada ([neˈβaða]), meaning "snow-covered" or "snowy".[17] The state takes its name from the Nevada Territory, which in turn was named for the Sierra Nevada.[18]

        Nevadans pronounce the second syllable with the "a" of "apple" (/nɪˈvædə/) while some people from outside of the state pronounce it with the "a" of "palm" (/nɪˈvɑːdə/).[19] Although the quality, but not the length, of the latter pronunciation is closer to the Spanish pronunciation (Spanish /a/ is open central [ä],[20] whereas American English /ɑː/ varies from back [ɑː] to central [äː]),[21] it is not the pronunciation used by Nevadans. State Assemblyman Harry Mortenson proposed a bill to recognize the alternative pronunciation of Nevada,[22] though the bill was not supported by most legislators and never received a vote. The Nevadan pronunciation is the one used by the state legislature. At one time, the state's official tourism organization, TravelNevada, stylized the name of the state as "Nevăda", with a breve over the a indicating the locally preferred pronunciation,[23] which was also available as a license plate design until 2007.</b></p><hr>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p><b>Before the arrival of Europeans, the earliest inhabitants were Indigenous tribes including the Goshute, Southern Paiute, Mohave, and Wašišiw (Washoe people).</b></p><hr>
